# Leaf-Microplastics-Detection

# To train the model


# To make inference with the trained model
1. Put the images you want to predict on inside inference/old_img
2. Run the inference_yolo_sahi.py script
3. Visualization of the predictions will be inside inference/new_img
4. area information of the microplastics will be inside final_output.json
